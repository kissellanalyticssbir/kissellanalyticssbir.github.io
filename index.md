## SBIR Project

The federally funded Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are designed to stimulate technological innovations by providing financial support to U.S. businesses that are conducting research and developing new technologies. The current project has been designed to better understand these programs, by exploring the types of projects that tend to receive funding, particularly those from the Department of Defense. This webpage provides the details of that project.
